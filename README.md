# Ruby: A (pointless) Workshop

Code developed in the workshop for [@cesium](https://github.com/cesium). Everything except for the `cursing` folder is as it was intended to be shown in the workshop. Slides are available [here](https://speakerdeck.com/frmendes/ruby-a-pointless-workshop).

The `cursing` folder contains the code for selecting who said "shit" the most, in a given day, on github commits. The code used there pretty much contains every little trick that was learned in the workshop.

Feel free to ask any questions!
